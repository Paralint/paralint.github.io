I was reading the FAQ on [how to be a hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), from Eric Raymond. I recognized in me many of the hacker traits - maybe even some of the skills. But I use a handle, ixe013.

 

One thing for sure, I love to solve problems and build things. When I started this web site, I pondered what license should I use for my software, or should I even publish the source at all.

 

Speaking with a friend, he asked me in pure [Covey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey) style : "[What are you doing this for ?](http://www.leaderu.com/cl-institute/habits/habit2.html)". 

 

I gave it some serious thoughts. And I remembered all the times open source software helped me solve a problem or learn something. I read the list of all the software I use, most are open source. It is the way I think, and what gives me the most inner peace. I think I have the [abundance mentality](http://lifehacker.com/software/mind-hacks/stop-procrastinating-with-the-abundance-mentality-143572.php) deep inside me. Any other way than open sourcing everything with the least limitations as possible seemed arrogant to me.

 

I didn't want to be arrogant. 

 

To be arrogant, people have to know you. You can build an aura around you and impose it to others. To avoid that, the easiest way I thought was to conceal my real name behind the [ixe013](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/IXE-13) handle. But it is silly. The time I spend concealing my identity (while [voluntary leaving traces](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/12/defeating_captc.html) all over) will be better spent trying and learning to hack.

 

No more hiding : My name is Guillaume, and I want to be a hacker.

 

2008 is going to be a big year. Not to mention the time I will spend trying to hack ;)
