I've been playing with web services for a while now. First code to hit production was in 2001. SOAP has come a long way since then... I am now focusing on computer security, actually making a living out of it.  
  
So this is a first post about securing a Web Services in J2EE with WSS. Not just by using HTTPS, but using a full fledged WS-Security setup. Things I have ready to run :  


  
	
  * WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (Geronimo)
  
	
  * Eclipse 3.2
  
	
  * Axis 1.4 (moving on to Axis 2.0 sometime, maybe)
  
  
Let's see how that goes !
