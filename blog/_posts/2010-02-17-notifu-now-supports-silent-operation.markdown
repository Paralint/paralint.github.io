I just release a small update to Notifu. You can now display a pop-up without playing the system event sound (-q). Notifu also supports the Windows 7 quiet time. By default, pop-up will not be displayed in the first hour or so after the very first logon. I you must display a pop, you can ignore the quiet time with the â€“w flag.

Go ahead and [download the new version](/projects/notifu/index.html#Download).
