I used to [my code in Google's subversion](2006/07/28/free-subversion-hosting-at-google-is-fun/). It was good, but I needed more. The built-in wiki was to restrictive, and I wanted to track usage and downloads.

So I signed up with DreamHost. The have shell access, lots of disk space, up and running subversion and one-click install Gallery and WordPress. My experience with their support is also very good !
