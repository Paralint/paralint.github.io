I followed advice from my father and learned how to type back in high school. Using a typewriter, in case you wonder. The first time I had to type something, I forced myself to "do it right", even though hunt and peck was faster. I now type quite fast, and I can type while looking at somebody. Might not qualify as listening, though...

Came across vi later. I found a quick reference, kept it on my desk and forced myself to learn and use the keys, event though it took me while to get it. Now, [vim](http://www.vim.org) is my editor of choice.

What does Google has to do with all this ? I was browsing their lab, and found they added [keyboard navigation to their search results](http://www.google.com/experimental/#BetaShortcuts). And they used vi syntax ! Now I only need to make that setting permanent...
