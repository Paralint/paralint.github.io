I was a little overwhelmed by the reaction to my custom GINA. The good thing about it is that it motivated me to put a better version out that addresses all the comments I had so far, namely :



	
  * Allow force log off without being a member of the administrator group

	
  * Allow an arbitrary group to be excluded from this GINA unlock policy

	
  * Show a notice that a custom GINA is in place


I also put up a [permanent page for the project](/projects/aucun/). It has better documentation and fancy graphics. Enjoy !
