Here is just a little update to my Notifu utility. It is a drop-in replacement (no new command-line switches) that features



	
  * Vista Home Premium and Vista Business support (same binary works on XP and Vista)

	
  * Better error handling on platforms that don't support IUserNotification

	
  * Option to specify pop-up delay in seconds (/d 5 or /d 5000 will give you 5 seconds)


I updated the [main project page](/projects/notifu/). There are a couple of typos and the email link is gone. I will fix that sometimes this week. Click on the bitmap here or on the project page to download.

Enjoy !
