# Installation

Notifu has no dependencies on anything. Just unzip the file somewhere and run it from there.

If you need a feature that Notifu doesn't provide, [ask me for it](guillaume@paralint.com). What's missing is easy to add. I just stopped when I had everything I needed.

If you haven't done so already, you can [look at the documentation](index.html) or [read about the implementation](code.html)
